1. Crowd fundings are a hit and miss in outcome, the United States overall are highly likely to crowdfund, but also likely to cancel/fail, as much as succeed.

2. The dataset lacks demographic information of the backers, individual dates of when backers pledged, and overall specifics of individual projects.

3. A pie graph can give a general illustration of the crowd funding outcomes for quicker conclusions (assume small number of backers). Also map charts can highlight the region/state/country of where a backer pledging from.
